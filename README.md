# BalkanID Data Science Task

## Introduction
The task delves into the groundbreaking computational models for processing information directly on graphs, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We were to find author and co-author suggestions based on the given dataset.
The project has been documented in 3 parts based on the task given.The model and other files have been uploaded along with the documents.

## Brief Description
#### [Part 1]
  This part consists the Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset, using Cypher queries and methologies enlisted within the documentation.

#### [Part 1]
  In this section I use PyTorch Geometric and GNN model to predict 5 most likely authors from the graph, who could co-author with the given author.

 #### [Part 3]
  This phase of the task required to deploy the model to the cloud, I used AWS Lambda to perform the same.
  The API and other information have been given in the document.
